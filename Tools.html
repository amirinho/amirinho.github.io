<p><h3>	Explain data migration tools </h3>
There are primary data migration tools considered when migrating data which consists of: 
	</br></br><b>• 	On-premise tools </b></br></br>
It is designed to migrate data within the network of an organisation. 
These solutions are designed to cater for data migration of two or more savers or databases within an organisational network without moving data to the cloud. This solution is vital when performing tasks like changing data warehouse or moving the primary data store  and 
many companies prefer on premise tools because of security restrictions 
Example of these tools include :<center></br> Microsoft SQL </br>
                                                       </br>   IBM InfoSphere </br>
                                                         </br>  Oracle Data Service Integrator </br></center>
 
<br></br><b>• Open source data migration tools </b></br></br>
Open source is a software that you can access , modify and distribute because it is generally made public and these solutions are relatively free or at a limited cost and these systems relatively easy use and compatability on systems is easier .Open source data migration tools can be an option for migrating data if the project is not large and complex .however it requires large coding skills 
 Example of these tools include : Apache NiFi 
                                                        <center>  <br></b> Data Loader </b></br>
                                                         <br></b>  Phinx  .</b></br></center>
														   
														<br></br><b> • Cloud based data migration tools </b></br></br>
Cloud based migration solutions are the latest generation and are designed to move the data             to the cloud be it from the on-premise store or another cloud based store. Cloud migration software   helps companies upgrade systems and update data by assisting in the relocation of files through the cloud. Often it provides features for data encryption, data backup and documentation for migration records.  
Example of these tools include: Alooma 
                                                      <center>  <br></b> Azure migrate</b> </br>
                                                       <br> </b> Google cloud </b></br></center>
