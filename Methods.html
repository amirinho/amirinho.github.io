<p><h3>	What are the data migration methods in cloud computing </h3>
To move applications and data to more advantageous environments, gather recommends data and applications as a means to overcome data gravity .firms improve their data management through data migration methods which are as follows: 
</br><b></br>Types of data migration BIG bang migration </b></br></br>
Big bang data migration is when the full transfer is completed within a limited time frame ,live systems experience downtime while data goes through ETL processing and transition to a new database .  in this method users experience a blockade in a single point I time where they can no longer use the old data until the new system goes live again 
Bigbang migrations typically have significant preparation periods and shorter down times, during which the system is unavailable. 
 
<br></br><b>TRICKLE MIGRATION </b></br></br>
A trickle migration approach can be likened to an agile form to data migration.in contrast the complete data migration process is done in phases ,during this process the old and the new system are run in parallel which eliminates downtime or operational interruptions.in this approach it allows all stakeholders to verify the success of every phase in data migration process submitting a significant sign of progress in this method. 
In comparison with the Bigbang method this implementation can be complex in design but if it is done right it usually reduces risks rather than adding them  
 
</br><b></br>Best practice for data migration </b></br></br></br>
</br><b>Back up the data before executing.</b> </br>
In case something goes wrong during the implementation phase the organisation can not afford to lose data so backing up resources is necessary until the whole method has been successful Stick to the strategy 
Many organisations tend to shift from the first intended plan then abandon it when things 
goes out of hand or gets complex and complicated.it can be frustrating at  times but 	
preparing for reality is the best approach and stick to one plan	 	
<b></br>Test, test, test. </b></br>
In the design, planning , implimantation and maintenance phase ,testing the data migration is a vital role and the key to a successful migration approach so as eventually achieving the desired outcome. 
 
 
8)	Explain data migration tools 
There are primary data migration tools considered when migrating data which consists of: 
	• 	On-premise tools 
It is designed to migrate data within the network of an organisation. 
These solutions are designed to cater for data migration of two or more savers or databases within an organisational network without moving data to the cloud. This solution is vital when performing tasks like changing data warehouse or moving the primary data store  and 
many companies prefer on premise tools because of security restrictions 
Example of these tools include : Microsoft SQL 
                                                          IBM InfoSphere 
                                                           Oracle Data Service Integrator 
 
• Open source data migration tools 
Open source is a software that you can access , modify and distribute because it is generally made public and these solutions are relatively free or at a limited cost and these systems relatively easy use and compatability on systems is easier .Open source data migration tools can be an option for migrating data if the project is not large and complex .however it requires large coding skills 
 Example of these tools include : Apache NiFi 
                                                           Data Loader 
                                                           Phinx
